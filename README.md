# SuperAdventure
A simple RPG game built using a Windows Form in C# based on the tutorial from 
https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/ 

I added some modifications to the game which:
- added an extra weapon(the Farm Scythe) with the game text and quest rewards updated to include it
- added a "Reset Game" button and function which allows the user to restore the game to it's original state


I have followed the tutorials up to lesson 19.5 and will update this repository when I progress through the other lessons.
